        <h2>What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?</h2>
        <p>
            The most interesting topic covered in this section is the variety of factuality factors and 
            how they can be implemented. One of the factors I would like to look at is Authenticity, where
            I can verify the claims made in the text against other sources.

        <h2>Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.</h2>
        <p>
            A potential investigation I would like to pursue is extracting the topics from the given text.
            This will be very useful as one of the factulaity factors I wanted to create was Authenticity. 
            Extracting the topic for the text would help me search up related articles and information.

        <h2>What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?</h2>
        <p>
            A potential change I would like to make to the approach taken is to look away from the default features
            that can be created simply from the given text. In particular, I would like to look for a way to get 
            data external. My mentor introduced us to a Google search API that could perhaps help us.

        <h2>What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?</h2>
        <p>
            A technique I would be interested in is combining different models together in order to create a better 
            model. At this moment, many of us are doing different models with different data. While our accuracy
            varies largely at the moment, I believe that we should be able to achieve a higher accuracy together with
            an ensemble model.
